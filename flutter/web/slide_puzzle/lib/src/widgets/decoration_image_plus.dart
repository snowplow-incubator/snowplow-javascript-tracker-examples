  /// middle of the bottom edge of its layout bounds.
  ///
  /// To display a subpart of an image, consider using a [CustomPainter] and
  /// [Canvas.drawImageRect].

  /// [AlignmentDirectional]), then a [TextDirection] must be available
  /// when the image is painted.
  ///
  /// Defaults to [Alignment.center].

  /// only horizontally and the region of the image to the left and right of
  /// the center slice will be stretched only vertically.
  ///
  /// The stretching will be applied in order to make the image fit into the box
  /// specified by [fit]. When [centerSlice] is not null, [fit] defaults to
  /// [BoxFit.fill], which distorts the destination image size relative to the
